# Chess_Cpp
This C++ program simulates a chess board. It is a work in progress version of my Chess_Java project. Destructor methods need to be implemented. Two players take turns as White and Black team. User input is given as the coordinates of the piece to be moved and coordinates of destination (to move or capture a piece at that location). The handling of draws will be improved. The stalemate checker needs to be tested thoroughly and expanded. For example, the draw condition "Insufficient Material for Checkmate" will be implemented (for, in the case of king vs. king and bishop).
